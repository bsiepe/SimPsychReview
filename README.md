## Reproducing our results

To reproduce the results of our literature review, refer to the files in the folder `/literature-review/`:
1. `analysis.Rmd` contains the main analyses in the paper and code to reproduce all figures.
2. `coding_agreement.Rmd` contains code to reproduce the agreement analyses in the appendix.
3. `lit_review_coding.pdf` contains the questions used in the literature review and displayed in the agreement analyses in the appendix. 

The folder `/data/` contain the raw data used in these scripts.


To reproduce our simulation example, refer to the files in the folder `/simulation-example/`:
1. `simulation_example.R` is the main simulation file used to generate, analyse, and summarize the simulation datasets.
2. `simulation_analysis.R` contains code to analyse and visualize the results of the simulation study and to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.
3. `session-info.txt` includes information on packages used and the computational environment.

  `/figures/` contains all figures related to both parts of the manuscript.
